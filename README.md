## Git vs. GitHub
###Git:
* Git is *version control*, which means that Git controls and tracks changes of your code.
* Git also runs in the command line, easy for editing code.
* Use the command `git` `something` to tell Git what to do. 

###Github:
* Github also runs in the command line.
* Collaboration is a big part of Github, because people can make changes to someone else's project(s).
* Visit `github.com`, sign up, and start editing code.

###Difference:
* Git is not on the cloud, meaning that you cannot save code with Git.
* You can only save code, on the cloud, with Github.

## Initial Setup
###Setting up your Github account:
* First, you must type your remote host on Github.
* You have to type in your `username`, `email` and `password`to sign up.

###SSH Key:
* This key is found on your coding program/platform.
* You can use it to connect your `localhost` with `Github`.
* Just `Ctrl/Command-C` the SSH Key and `Ctrl/Command-V` it into your remote, 
in order to sync changes you make in your coding platform.

###Git Config:
* When you first initialize Git, it starts allowing you to use the command `git config`.
* This lets you setup your `user.name` and `user.email`, so that when you make changes to code, Git will know who made those changes.
